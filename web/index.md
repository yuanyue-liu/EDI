Electron-defect interaction is crutial to many processes and applications, such as charge transport and light absoprtion/emission. **EDI** (**e**lectron-**d**efect **i**nteraction) is a computer code to calculate the electron-defect interaction from first principles. 

# Capabilities

Currently, the EDI can calculate the following quantities for charge-neutral point defect:

-  defect pertubation potential and matrix
-  relaxation time/scattering rate
-  transport properties such as carrier mobility 

We are implmenting/plan to implement the following defect types:
-  charged defect
-  surface
-  grain boundary
